we need some framework we can train:

should test on cifar first tho to make sure we like it first.

8 V100s to train ResNet50 @ 120 minutes

wonder if we setup this dataset if we can use the distributed training ...

On Local machine with good images:

===========

> yeah so once again res blocks are being the problem

initial idea was pass {qx, x} everywhere 
so we can just do 

x + y1
in resblock
rather than 
qx + qy1

but that dosnt work
because we scale the weights, but not the activations

===========

best new idea
is just finding the y_scale during training or something.

===========

hmm
what about passing y / scale through
and just doing it all during collection ? 

===========

so current setup is almost there
thinking the problem is collecting mean,var,scale at the same time.

because mean and var change as a function of scale.

===========

theory = cannot change scale and {mean, var} together.
need to do 2 separate collects
