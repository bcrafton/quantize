there are so few files.

doing diff on layers between these different branches is whack as well.

code is so different for some reason

wow - so it seems like we switched to tensorflow2 ... on branch tf2.
so we def want tf2 or later.

tf2_resnet dosnt have cifar10
also it dosnt seem like it does training either
because it automatically assumes we are starting with weights.

should get whatever remaining commits are left on server for quantize

nothing there.

(2)
move collect inside, use .numpy() to collect {scale, std, mean}
